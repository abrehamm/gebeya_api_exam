# Gebeya API Exam

- This is a mock-up app done in response to Gebeya's API backend practical exam.

- To keep it simple, Swagger docs are provided for a selected endpoints & models only.

- uses MongoDB for database, assuming it will be running on port 27017. (If app is run from cloned repo, otherwise Docker covers that.)
